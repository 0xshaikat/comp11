###Deep Blue
- Development began in 1985 for the chess playing computer that would defeat world chess champion Garry Kasparaov for the first time in 1996.
- After going on to lose this initial set of games, 4 to 2, Deep Blue went on to beat Kasparov in the rematch
- The games pitted Deep Blue's computation power against Kasparov's intuition about game state.
- Kasparov was a particularly sore loser, claiming that Deep Blue cheated.

####factorial

	//factorial in a while loop
	int seed;
	int factorial = 1;
	
	while (seed > 0)
	{
		factorial *= seed;
		seed--;
	}
	
	//factorial in a for loop
	int seed;
	int factorial = 1;
	
	for (int i = 1; i <= seed; i++)
	{
		factorial *= i;
	}
	
####more examples

	//print every even number between 0 and x
	for (int i = 2; i <= x; i +=2)
	{
		cout << i << endl;
	}
	
-use for loops!
-unless...you do not know how many times the loop will run

	//determine whether or not a number is prime
	int x;
	
	cout << "Enter number to compute prime:\n";
	cin >> x;
	
	bool not_prime = false;
	
	for (int i = 2; i < x; i++)
	{
		if  (x % i == )
		{
			cout << "your number is not prime.\n";
			//break out of loop
			break;
		}
	}
	
	if (!not_prime)
	{
		cout << "PRIME TIME!!!!\n";
	}
