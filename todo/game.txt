can:
draw one card
shuffle card
check cards value

conditions:
boolean deck_empty;
boolean is_face;
boolean is_even;
boolean is ace_of_spades;

constraints:
2 or more players
win by points

PSUEDOCODE FOR A_GAME_OF_PRIMES:

//declaration of vars
boolean deck_empty;
boolean is_face;
boolean is_even;
boolean is ace_of_spades;

int player1;
int player2;
char continue;
char endgame;
do{
        do {
        shuffle cards;
        draw one card;
        add value of card to player 1;
        cout << "do you want to keep drawing?\n Y or N.";
        cin >> continue;
        }
        while( continue == 'Y');
        //player 2
        do {
        shuffle cards;
        draw one card;
        add value of card to player 1;
        cout << "do you want to keep drawing?\n Y or N.";
        cin >> continue;
        }
        while( continue == 'Y');
}
cout << "continue game?\n (Y or N);
cin >> endgame;
}
while (endgame == 'Y' && !(deck_empty));

//then
check if ints are primes
if not, the one closest to the any prime wins
