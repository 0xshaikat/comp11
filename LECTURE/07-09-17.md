####**Outline**
1. Software Design
2. Algorithms
3. Code, computers, and humans

####**I. software design**
1. remember things
2. repeat things
3. communicate
4. make decisions

#### **end-to-end**
- design-> implementation-> debug

####**design**

**pseudocode**
- how the computer will do the code
- bullet points
- high level steps
- can be modified 
- should be reusable
- should be nimble
**why pseudocode?**
- don't lose logic in computer mindset
- helps to make modular, efficient code
- reduce errors and the need for debugging
- break big problem into small problem
- clarify your solution
- identify errors
	
	//pseudocode to move Dr. Laney to the back door
	//she can take one step or turn clockwise x degrees
	// series of (heading, distance) commands
	
####**II. algorithms**
- ==Algorithm== - set of precise instructions to carry out a program
- components of an agorithm that will carry from one step to another are ==variables== and ==instructions==
- ==variable== - name associated with a value (they remember)
- ==instructions== - transfer and transform information

Facebook:
**VARIABLES**: birthdays, what you bought, list of friends, profile picture, username and password
**INSTRUCTIONS**: date, display ad, modify your list of friends, generate a wall feed, notifies about likes and comments/tags

####**III. Code, computers, and humans**
> Write a program to calculate distance travelled and calculate average miles per gallon 

> User tells us: starting mileage, ending mileage, number of gallons used

	// example problem for 07-09-17
	#include <iostream>
	using namespace std;
	int main(){
	    int startmileage, endmileage, gallons, distance, mpg;
	    cout<< "What is your starting mileage?\n";
	    cin >> startmileage;
	    cout<< "What is your ending mileage?\n";
	    cin >> endmileage;
	    cout <<"How many gallons of gas have you used?\n";
	    cin >> gallons;
	    distance = endmileage - startmileage;
	    mpg = distance / gallons;
	    cout << "Your distance is " << distance << "." << endl;
	    cout << "Your average mpg is " << mpg << "." << endl;
	}

- Programmer has to declare a variable and inititalize it as well
- Programmer has to specify value
- Computer has to reserve a spot in memory and save the value in the memory
