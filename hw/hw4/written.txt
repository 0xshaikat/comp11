PSEUDOCODE FOR BUFFY.CPP:
Functions:

Name: valid
Purpose: validate integer inputs.
Parameters: none
Returns: int

Name: end_game
Purpose: return a bool based on if the simulation has ended
Parameters: (int &stakes, int &vamps, bool &buffy_alive);
Returns: bool

Name: stake
Purpose: Stake a vampire.
Parameters: (int attacker, int &num_stakes, int &vamps, bool &buffy_alive);
Returns: void

Name: spell
Purpose: Cast a spell.
Parameters: (int attacker, int &num_stakes, int &vamps, bool &buffy_alive);
Returns: void

Name: choice
Purpose: Makes the choice.
Parameters: (int attack, int attacker, int &num_stakes,int &vamps, bool
&buffy_alive)
Returns: void

Name: print_result
Purpose: Prints result of encounter.
Parameters: (&vamps, &num_stakes, &buffy_alive)
Returns: void

Name: main
Purpose: Run a simulation of Buffy out on patrol with the Scooby gang,
Willow, and Xander.
Parameters: std input
Returns: 0, std output

When to call the function:
- in main, use a while loop with the function call of end_game
- in while loop, call encounter
- in encounter call valid() twice to get input for users choice to attack and
who to use to attack (Buffy, Willow, and Xander)
- in same while loop, call choice
- in choice, call stake if attack is 0
- in stake, call srand(time(NULL))
- in choice, call spell if attack is 1
- in spell, call srand(time(NULL))
- in choice, call run if attack is anything else
- in run, call rand()
- in same while loop, call print_result
- end while loop
