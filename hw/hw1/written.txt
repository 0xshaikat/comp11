Written #1:

1a. For the num_students variable, I would use the int data type as the number
of students would be a whole integer number; I wouldn't use the short data type
even if it is an integer type because the number of students at a large research
university may be larger than 32,767.
1b. For the avg_exam_grade variable, I would use the double data type to adjust
for a good degree of precision in its digits, as well as to account for the
decimal component in the avg_exam_grade var.
1c. For the first_name variable, I would use the string class; memory should not
be much of a problem as it is dynamically allocated.

2a. int current_inning;
2b. current_inning = 6;
2c. const double EARNED_RUN = 2.38

Written #3:

GIVEN THAT:
- a STANDARD PBJ SANDWICH IS composed of
  - 30 mL peanut butter
  - 30 mL grape jelly
  - 2 (1.25cm x 10cm x 10cm) bread slices
- 'ingredients/utensils' are defined as:
  - one butterknife (Yangjiang Market Value Enterprise Company Limited branded,
   if possible)
  - Justin's TM All Natural Peanut Butter ( 453.592 g )
  - Welch's Jelly Concord Grape ( 510.291 g )
  - one loaf of 1.25cm x 10cm x 10cm bread slices (whole wheat, if possible)
  - one ceramic plate, (Dewick or Carmichael)

- the robot is capable of discerning the difference between the ingredients
through the use of an edge detection system/camera in combination with
limited artificial intelligence (to navigate its surrounding, and order
ingredients through amazon pantry, or have them acquired by a human)

- the robot possesses articulate movement, similar to a human's ability to grasp
and delicately spread ingredients

1. calibrate position of robot so that robot is 14cm away from the table, with
   its 'hands' positioned 10cm above the table surface;
2. initialize check for ingredients/utensils necessary for a STANDARD PBJ
    on the table;
2. if (ingredients/utensils not present)
       acquire ingredients through amazon pantry;
       repeat step 2;
   else
       go to step 3;
3. initiate protocol to check for the openness of the jars of peanut butter and
   jelly, as well as if the bread packaging is open;
4. if (all ingredients opened)
      go to step 5;
  else
      open ingredients (through assistance of the robot's articulate 'hands',
      edge detection system, and artificial intelligence);
      go to step 5;
5. acquire two bread slices;
6. place each bread slice 2 cm away from each other on the ceramic plate;
7. grasp butterknife;
8. position butterknife in Justin's TM All Natural Peanut Butter Jar;
9. using volume measuring protocol, place 30mL of peanut butter on butterknife;
10. spread 30ml of peanut butter on one piece of bread;
11. place piece of bread on plate;
12. clean butterknife of all peanut butter residue;
13. position butterknife in Welch's Grape Jelly;
14. spread 30ml of grape jelly on piece of bread without any condiments on it
    (as detected by the computer's camera/AI system)
15. place piece of bread on plate, 2cm from the other one;
16. clean butterknife of all jelly residue;
17. place butterknife on table;
18. grasp the two pieces of bread, condiment side up, on both 'hands';
19. position the two pieces of bread together, using .5N of force;
20. place this 'sandwich' on plate;
21. profit???

Psuedocode for Programming Problem #3:

Variables:

Point system.
- int points; (stores total number of points)

Choice system.
- char choice;

Constant integers for adding point values.
- const int plus_one = 1;
- const int plus_two = 2;
- const int plus_three = 3;

User input.
- string user_query = "What's yo name?";
- string name; (for username)

This is for the beginning of the game, once the user has entered the labyrinth.
- string welcome_one = "Bienvenidos. Welcome. Wilkommen. This is the labyrinth,
  You have entered it. By it, I mean "labyrinth". Your name is ";
- string welcome_two = " That is good. Please enjoy your visit."
- string welcome_three = "Your cousin's niece's uncle's dad Luke is sobbing."


These are for all the questions.
- string q_one = "Oh no! Or, oh yes. A Young Thugger Girl has taken Luke. Do you
  rap battle to gain the THUGGER POWER???";
- string q_two = "You've gained the THUGGER POWER! But you only have 3 hours to
  find Luke, which can only be done with SOSA.\nSosa is waiting for you. Do you
  stalk Sosa to get back Luke?";
- string q_three = "UH...Do you NOT sacrifice the features to save Luke?";

These are all the responses for each question, based on user input.
- string y_q_one = "What a brave soul. The power of thugger is now second nature
  to you.";
- string n_q_one = "Wrong answer. You die. Luke dies. Everyone...just dies!";
- string y_q_two = "Good job! Sosa is appreciative and gives you forty new
  features on his latest album. You can sacrifice the features to save Luke." ;
- string n_q_two = "Sosa doesn't trust you. Sosa removes you from the lair and
  transports you to Medford/Sommerville." ;
- string y_q_three = "AYYY! You good. NO ONE likes Luke. You are now. A. Rapper!
  Go win some grammys. Maybe save your hometown from overzealous yuppies.";
- string n_q_three = "Was Luke really worth it? You lost all your power to save
  some random dude. Gosh. Talk about choices." ;

These are all the outcomes (three of them, based on final point value).
- string outcome_one = "You're wack. Go home and listen to some LOGIC.";
- string outcome_two = "Ayy. You're mediocre. UH...You like JCole?" ;
- string outcome_three = "You're perffffff. Good stuff. Keep on keepin' on." ;

PSEUDOCODE for Labyrinth:

- print user_query;
- print welcome_one + name + welcome_two + welcome_three;
- print q_one;
- input choice;
- if the choice is 'Y':
     - add plus_one to points;
     - print y_q_one;
     - print q_two;
     - input choice;
 - else:
     - print n_q_one;
     - print points;
     - print outcome_one
     - exit;
     - if the choice to question two is yes:
        - add plus_two to points;
        - print y_q_two;
        - print q_three;
        - input choice;
     - else:
        - print n_q_two;
        - print points;
        - if points are from 1 to 4:
           - print outcome_one;
        - else:
             - print outcome_two;
             - exit;
        - if the choice to question three is yes:
           - print y_q_three;
           - points += plus_three;
           - print points;
           - print outcome_three;
        - else:
           - print n_q_three;
           - print points;
           - if points are from 1 to 4:

Written #5:
One of the errors I got was a compiler error named the 'not-found error' that
was not able to find 'cin' and 'cout', which were not defined. Then I realized
that I hadn't declared 'namespace std', so the compiler was unable to find
'cin' and 'cout' from the std namespace. I also got a warning for an unused
expression, which I fixed by using the variable/expression in question.
