The name of the function is pow(), which stands for raise to the power. There
are two parameters of type double, and the return type of the function is a
double.

The include statement required for this function is '#include <math.h>'.
To call this function to determine 13^2, use the following code:
double result = pow(13, 2);

PSEUDOCODE FOR PROGRAMMING #2:
constants:
// Number of points needed to win
const int THRESHOLD = 20;
// Players
const int P_ONE = 1;
const int P_TWO= 2;
//bank or hold
const int BANK = 0;
const int HOLD = 1;
// Total number of points for each player.
int pone_points = 0, ptwo_points = 0;
// Whose turn it is. Player One always starts.
int turn = P_ONE;
// Is the game over yet
bool game_over = false;
//the dice
int current = random roll of the dice from 1 to 6 exclusive

-first while loop runs so long as game_over is false
-next while loop runs so long as the boolean round_over is false
-ask user if they want to bank or hold
-next while loop runs so long as user continues to decide to bank
-if the dice rolls a 1, end round, add 0 to player one pone_points,
call switch_turn(), call check_for_win(), set game_over to true if a player has
won, call announce_points()
-if its not a 1, add result to round_points,
ask the user if they want to bank or hold
-if they bank, repeat above 3 steps
-if they hold, add round_points to respective player's score,
call check_for_win() and set game_over to true if a player has won,
call announce_points(), call switch_turn() if no one has won
-repeat above 7 steps so long as threshold is not reached and
game_over is false
-outside of while loop, game is over and print "thanks for playing"
